 * {0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42} and then we want to fill in 
 * the rest of the gaps uniformly, so for each number we
 * can add a random number from 0 - 6. So we add rand7() - 1. 
 * Then we have rand49() and we can discard the numbers bigger
 * than or equal to 40. So we take mod 10 to get random
 * 0 - 9 and then add 1 to get random 1 - 10.
